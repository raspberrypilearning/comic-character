In HTML, the `<input>` element is a form element commonly used to collect user input.

Which attribute is used to specify the category of input the user can enter?

--- choices ---

- (x) `type`

  --- feedback ---

  Correct! The `type` attribute in the `<input>` element is used to specify the type of input the user can enter, such as text, password, checkbox, etc.

- ( ) `data-input`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite! The data- prefix is used for custom data attributes, not for specifying the type of input.

- ( ) `input-type`

  --- feedback ---
  
Not quite! The syntax `input-type` is not an attribute in the `<input>` element and will not specify the category of input the user can enter.
