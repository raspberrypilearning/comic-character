To create a function in JavaScript, you use the `function` keyword.

What is the basic structure of a function?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `new function myFunction() { /* code here */ }`

  Not quite! The correct way to declare a function is without the 'new' keyword.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `function myFunction { /* code here */ }`

  --- feedback ---

  Almost! Brackets are required after the function name. These are used to hold any parameters used by the function. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) `function myFunction() { /* code here */ }`

  --- feedback ---
  
  That's correct! A function includes the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, brackets, and curly braces containing the function's code.
