## Introduction


In this project, you will combine JavaScript, HTML and CSS, to create a website where your users can design their own superhero character. 

The website also features light and dark modes and includes a captcha for exclusive content access.


<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Captcha**</span> is a security tool that adds protection by checking the difference between humans and automated bots using challenges.
